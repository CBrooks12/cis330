In my findings, I noticed that the colors took about the same amount of time to
execute. Blue sometimes ended up being faster, but the difference was
negligable. The blender function took as long as both of the colors combined
(on average). I Had to run the tests multiple times to get an accurate reading
due to inconsistancies. Every time I doubled the size of the image, the times
of the functions seemed to grow proportonally as expected. The most noticable
time was the jump from 1000x1000 to 2000x2000 where the time varied from around
.20 seconds to .80 seconds for blender.
